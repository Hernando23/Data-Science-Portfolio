The pinnacle of his career so far came at the Alteryx Inspire Conference in 2013 where, pitted against nine other Alteryx super-users, he totaled the best time overall to become the first Grand Prix winner outside North America. He won the championship again in 2014.</p>

     <em>"My favorite thing about Alteryx is that it makes my job fun. No one enjoys spending hours in Excel or wants to spend time writing programs when they are looking for data insight. Alteryx allows me to get to the crux of any problem quickly, and means I spend less time on the mundane and more time on the analysis, where I believe I can add real value. I want to share my passion for Alteryx with as many people as possible. While I consider myself a technical expert who is happy to engage with advanced use cases, my real passion is engaging with new users and helping them find the same power in Alteryx as I first did."</em></p></td>
